    <p>Hello, my name is Steven Domiter and I am currently a senior at the University of Wisconsin Madison.
        I am studying Cartography/GIS and Civil/Environmental engineering.
        I love the outdoors and try to spend as much time as possible sailing, snowboarding, hiking or just being outside.
